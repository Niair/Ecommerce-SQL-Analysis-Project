# 📊 Ecommerce SQL Analysis Project

This project contains structured SQL queries and views built on a relational **Ecommerce SQL Database**. It showcases advanced querying skills using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `subqueries`, `aggregate functions`, and `views` for in-depth data analysis.

## 📁 Dataset Tables

The database is composed of the following dimension and fact tables:

- `customer_dim`: Contains customer personal details.
- `fact_table`: Contains sales/payment transactional records.
- `item_dim`: Item catalog with prices, descriptions, origin, and supplier info.
- `store_dim`: Store location hierarchy (division, district, upazila).
- `time_dim`: Temporal data (date, week, month, quarter, year).
- `trans_dim`: Transaction types and associated banks.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL compatible syntax)
- GitHub for version control
- Optional: Compatible with data visualization tools (Power BI, Streamlit, Tableau)
